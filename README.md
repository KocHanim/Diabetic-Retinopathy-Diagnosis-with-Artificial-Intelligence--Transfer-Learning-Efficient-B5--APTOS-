# First of all, let's talk about why Ophthalmology and Artificial Intelligence overlap so much:

The most important feature that distinguishes ophthalmology from other branches is that it uses especially the sense of sight in the clinic. 
They see pathological findings in patients and make a diagnosis by analysing them. Nowadays, with the increase in the computing power of computers, deep learning models have become able to analyse images. 
Since most of the data to be analysed in ophthalmology is image-based and therefore the analysis of the data is related to image recognition,
processing the data and making a diagnosis with decision mechanisms appropriate to the processed data is a very suitable area for ophthalmology Artificial Intelligence cooperation.
 
# So why is Artificial Intelligence research in the literature particularly focused on Diabetic Retinopathy, although there are dozens of eye-related diseases? 


According to research, Diabetic Retinopathy affects one in every 3 people with diabetes and is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. 
Of the more than 400 million people with diabetes worldwide, 10%, or about 40 million, have vision-threatening Diabetic retinopathy. 
Diabetic patients generally do not visit a doctor for regular retinal screening unless there is a symptom affecting their vision. However, 
the importance of regular eye check-ups to prevent vision loss with the early diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy has become evident, as a significant portion of the development of the disease progresses stealthily. 
The increasing number of diabetic individuals worldwide, along with a shortage of trained eye doctors, has drawn the attention of the healthcare sector to the use of artificial intelligence technology for retinopathy diagnosis. 
In various research studies using successful artificial intelligence algorithms, when we examine the values of sensitivity and specificity on paper, 
it is observed that artificial intelligence can make more successful diagnoses than even eye specialists.
